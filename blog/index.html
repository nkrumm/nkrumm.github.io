	<p>
		I am a graduate student in the <span class='highlight'>Genome Sciences department at the University of Washington</span>, in Evan Eichler’s laboratory. I study the role of genetics in autism spectrum disorder, develop algorithms for discovering and analyzing copy number variation. I’m also interested in programming, learning clojure, health care information technology, topics I occaisionally post about. You will find me back in medical school, completing my degree in 2016. I live in Seattle, WA. I love to ski, hike, run, play complex board games, build things and listen to music.
